# MP3 player with Rasberry Pi components
This is an MP3 player which utilizes OMX Player (a function already apart of the raspberry pi system). 
This python file allows you to store and use music from a usb and then show the stored album cover and song information. 
The code also initializes 4 buttons on a Raspberry Pi's breadboard (Previous, Stop, Play/Pause, and Skip) and an LED to show when a song is currently playing (green) and when it is paused or stopped (red).
